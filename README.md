This repository contains all the packages developed so far for the simulation in the ROS/Gazebo environment of the stintboat currently
being built by the METCAP/FabLab at the Technological University of Panama. The packages contained in this repository represent a first
stable build.

The stintboat_description package makes heavy use of the VRX simulation environment, which is available here: https://github.com/osrf/vrx
